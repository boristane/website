        I'm Boris Tane, I build <a href="/projects">things on the internet 💻</a>.

      <section class="tldr"><strong>TLDR:</strong> I make things, I love Physics, music 🎶, and anime; and recently I happen to be obsessed
        with productivity software 💽.</section>

      <section>
        <p>Growing I wanted to be an inventor, because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Urkel">Steve
            Urkel</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Matters">Family Matters</a>. I'm sure not many in Britain know this 90s show, but where I'm
          from (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaound%C3%A9">Yaoundé, Cameroon</a> 🇨🇲), it was a big deal.</p>
        <p>I ended up studying Physics and moving to the UK 🇬🇧 for a MSc Aerospace Dynamics at <a
            href="https://cranfield.ac.uk">Cranfield University</a>.</p>
            <p>I absolutely loved it. 🌷</p>
            <p>Unlike other Masters in
              Aerospace Engineering, this one was focused on Flight Dynamics, which is a fancy name for programming for
              planes. Ah, I forgot to mention I started writing C code when I was 14, as I wanted to make the next <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Bandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a>.</p>
        <p>My video game designer dreams were short-lived. 🎮</p>
        <p>Somewhere between my Bsc and my MSc, I started a software development shop with my childhood friend <a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cedric-tchana-wandji-77331095/">Cedric Tchana</a>. It was more a pretext
          to meetup everyday and play videos games than a business. It was fun though.</p>
        <p>I started my "real" career in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_engineering">Wind
            Engineering</a> industry. 🍃</p>
        <p>Don't ask me why. 🤔</p>
        <p>I was a "Project Engineer", which is a weird blend of consultant and aerodynamics engineer. I worked in the
          industry for a few years and spent most of my time building internal tools to help the teams. I was pretty
          good at it, not gonna lie. I then started working within both the software and the aerodynamics teams.</p>
        <p>Alongside this, I teamed up with a couple of friends to build "the participative encyclopedia of Cameroonian
          urban music".</p>
        <p>We had no idea what we were doing. 🙃</p>
        <p>The result is <a href="https://mounastete.com">mounastete.com</a>, a website where Cameroonian rap
          enthusiasts, producers and musicians met to share their love for the culture. I honestly don't remember the
          numbers, but I can recall being at the same time satisfied and disastisfied with the traffic. But let's be
          honest, it was a failure 💀. We quit after about a year.</p>
        <p>Next thing I know, I'm building a community around "Afro-Caribbean literature in French". Did I mention I
          speak French? Well, for once I was good at naming something: <a
            href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/labiblioafro">La Biblio Afro</a> 📚. I grew this community to more than
          1k active members in less than 6 months.</p>
        <p>Now the real deal: my software career. In 2017 I started sharing <a href="/projects">my work</a> on the web
          more, and I started getting a few recruiters in my DMs 💬. After a few interviews, I landed at <a
            href="https://seatfrog.com">Seatfrog</a> as a Software Engineer 🐸. The team had just moved to London from
          Sydney and was building the software team. I was engineer n4.</p>
        <p>I was shitting my pants. 👖</p>
        <p>I spent a bit more than a couple of years at Seatfrog. I learned so much during these years, even things I
          wasn't realising I was learning at the time. I made lifelong friends, discovered what it is to be in an early
          stage startup, and built a lot of cool shit.</p>
        <p>I kept exploring with code on the side, playing with APIs, and exploring new things. I launched a few
          experiments and started hanging out on <a href="https://twitter.com/boristane">Twitter</a> 🐦.
        </p>
        <p>I also wasted a lot of time (months) building an <a href="https://lesleyapp.com">audio journaling app</a> 📅,
          which I never released. Again, don't ask me why.</p>
        <p>One of those experiments turned out to become a thing a lot of people loved and were willing to pay for: <a
            href="https://bkmark.io">Bkmark</a>. A bookmarks manager 🔖, which now does much more, and I don't want to have
          to update this page every time it does one new thing.</p>
        <p>I actually like working on links and bookmarks. It sounds like a simple problem from the surface, but it's
          actually a pretty hard problem to solve.</p>
        <p>Apart from all of this, I love music. I had a very short career as a producer and rapper in my teens. I
          always thought everyone did, but evidently no.</p>
        <p>I like to believe I'm still an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku">otaku</a> 🇯🇵 but not gonna lie, I
          watch pretty mainstream anime and very sporadically these days. But my little collection of anime <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funko#Product_lines">Funko Pops</a> maintains the illusion.</p>
        <p>I watch Basketball and I can't talk about it all. the. time 🏀. <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook">Russel Westbrook</a> should be MVP every year.</p>
