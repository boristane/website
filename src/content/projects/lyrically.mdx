I listen to a lot of french rap, and before Spotify had lyrics available from within the app, I'd always google *Rap Genius :song name:* when listening to music. One day I decided to automate it.

I uses the [Genius API](https://docs.genius.com/) to get the song lyrics and it continuously polls the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to get the current song.
