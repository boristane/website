Developers are on the front-lines dealing with errors and performance issues every day, but they are not equiped with the right tooling: "logs, metrics and traces" are not enough. You need 3 core concepts:
- High cardinality and dimensionality
- OpenTelemetry
- Great Developer Experience

I started [Baselime](https://baselime.io) to solve this problem.

It was a wild ride, building a team, bringing our vision to the world and enabling developers worldwide to solve issues before they become problems.

Baselime has now [joined Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-acquires-baselime-expands-observability-capabilities).
