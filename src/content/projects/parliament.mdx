I wanted to dig deeper into the results of the [2017 United Kingdom general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_Kingdom_general_election), so I built this front-end application to visually represent:
- election results 
- lost constituencies
- gender representation
- turnout
- majority

This project was mostly a pretext to play with [d3.js](https://d3js.org/)
