For my [MSc Aerospace Dynamics](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/courses/taught/aerospace-dynamics) thesis, I modified a low-cost commercial fixed wing UAV to instrument it with various sensors such as a pitot tube, an inertial measurement unit, and an air-ground data link.

The instrumentation enabled me to flight test the aircraft and to capture data in various flight conditions.

I used the data to build and validate 2 models of the aircraft:
- a [6 Degrees of Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_freedom) model based on the equations of motion of the aircraft
- a [maximum likelihood estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation) model based on the statistical analysis of the flight data

This was a lot of fun with Matlab :)
