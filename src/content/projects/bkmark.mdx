I'm a tab hoarder. This project is an attempt to solve this problem: a fully serverless application to store all my tabs such that I finally close them. I added a bunch of quality of life features over the months and turned this into a SaaS.

It was mostly a learning experience for me. I explored how to build a completely serverless application: compute, database, storage, queues, webhooks, etc.
