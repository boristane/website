The [Serverless London Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/serverless-london/) invited me to give a talk, and I wanted to share something different: what's the engineering culture that enables us at [Baselime](https://baselime.io) to innovate extremely fast?

One of the key points is observability. How we leverage our observability tooling to have high velocity and quality software at the same time.

I gave this talk twice, and this is was the first iteration. In the second iteration, at the [Node Congress 2023 conference](./creating-an-innovation-engine-with-observability-v2), I incorporated feedback and improvements from this talk.
