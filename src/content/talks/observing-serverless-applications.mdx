I teamed up with [Kyle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kylegalbraith459/) to share the best practices to observe serverless applications.

The talk is all about high-cardinality and dimensionality wide events, how to create them and leverage to build more observable serverless applications, with practical examples and real-world scenarios.
