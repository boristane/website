I had the opportunity to speak at the [Serverless London Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/serverless-london/) once again and this time I wanted to share with developers how they can build their own observability tooling using serverless primitives and host it themselves.

It was pretty fun to break down Baselime into its core components and share with developers what goes on in each, and how they can build it themselves.

Fun fact: for some reason I needed to use my mouse instead of a pointer to flick through slides - this was way more challenging than I anticipated.
