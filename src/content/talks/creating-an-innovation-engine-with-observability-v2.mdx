I was invited to give a talk at [Node Congress 2023](https://portal.gitnation.org/events/node-congress-2023); I spent quite a few days wondering what I could present; I had given a talk about [creating an innovation engine with observability](./creating-an-innovation-engine-with-observability-v1) before, which people liked and I knew it could be improved and resonate with even more developers.

And that's exactly what I did. I made a few key changes to the talk and delivered it again. All about the culture changes that teams can make today to produce quality software without compromising on iteration speed.

Node Congress doesn't allow embedding talk recordings, so you can find it on [their website](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/creating-an-innovation-engine-with-observability).
