I was invited to give a talk at [Node Congress 2023](https://portal.gitnation.org/events/node-congress-2023); I spent quite a few days wondering what I could present; I had given a talk about [creating an innovation engine with observability](./creating-an-innovation-engine-with-observability-v1) before, which people liked and I knew it could be improved and resonate with even more developers.

And that's exactly what I did. I made a few key changes to the talk and delivered it again. All about the culture changes that teams can make today to produce quality software without compromising on iteration speed.
