[London Node User Group](https://lnug.org/) invited me to give a talk, and that came up when I was wondering if I could squeeze more performance out of my JavaScript [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions without re-writing in Go or Rust.

I then benchmarked [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Deno](https://deno.com/) and [Bun](https://bun.sh/) on AWS Lambda... The benchmark results themselves are not quite relevant as those runtimes are evolving very quickly; the most interesting part was the journey of deploying unsupported runtimes on AWS Lambda.

This talk is about how to deploy custom runtimes on AWS Lambda, and measure and compare the duration of HTTP requests made to those functions. It's also a great demo of a very early version of [Baselime](https://baselime.io).
